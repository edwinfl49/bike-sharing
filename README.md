# Predicting Bike Rentals

Predicting bike rentals using decision trees. The goals of this project are:
- Utilize a decision tree regressor, and a random forest regressor to forecast demand for bike rentals
- Compare the effectiveness of these two algorithms with linear regression
- Also perform tasks leading up to model training, including cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering

This project started as a part of the Dataquest.io curriculum, with some modifications and additions.

The data set is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found here:
